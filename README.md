Just wrapped up a **Sales Dashboard in Excel**, and I’m convinced Excel deserves employee of the month for holding everything together.  

This dashboard uncovers all the business secrets we usually pretend we don’t know:  
• **Sales by Category** – because some categories clearly think they’re the main character.  
• **Profit Gained Over Time** – also known as “Are we growing, or just hoping?”  
• **Sales by State** – states battling it out like a sales version of the IPL.  
• **Customer Count** – the more, the merrier… and more formulas.  
• **Top 5 Profit-Making Customers** – the legends who keep the lights on.  
• **Monthly Sales** – featuring highs, lows, and moments of pure suspense.  

Built using pivot tables, charts, slicers, conditional formatting, and an Excel sheet that almost crashed three times but stayed loyal.
